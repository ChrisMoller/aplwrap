To install aplwrap, it's necessary to have a copy of the GNU APL source code 
installed at least for the duration of the installation of aplwrap. (In order 
to ensure that aplwrap and GNU APL agree on the Unicode-Quad-AV mapping, aplwrap
references appropriate file from GNU APL.)  The GNU APL source can be discarded
after aplwrap is installed.

The configuration process will try to find the APL source code.  If it can't
and the build subsequently fails, you can manually specify the location by using
a something like the following:

   ./configure --with-apl-source-dir=/mnt/disk5/home/moller/tinkering/aplplot/apl-1.5/src

aplwrap requires GTK+ version 3.16 or newer, including the development
package (like gtk3-devel) if your distribution separates that from the GTK+
library package.

The ./configure file used by aplwrap was created with automake version 1.13.4.
This doesn't work with some newer Linux distributions.  If that's the case, you
can rebuild the configuration by running:

   ./autogen.sh 

Once the above is in place:

	./configure	(with --with-apl-source-dir if necessary)
	make
	sudo make install

Optionally, if you like, you can alias "aplwrap" to something shorter--
I alias it to "aw."
