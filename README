aplwrap is a GTK+-based wrapper for GNU APL.

Usage:
  aplwrap [OPTION...]

Help Options:
  -h, --help               Show help options
  --help-all               Show all help options
  --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options

Application Options:
  -s, --ftsize             Integer font size in points.
  -v, --vwidth             Use variable width font.
  -x, --xeq                Set an absolute or on-path executable APL 
				other than the default, "apl".  (This
				is primarily intended to allow the use
				of uninstalled copies of APL --
					aplwrap -x ./apl
				-- for development purposes.  It's 
				unlikely to work with anything other
				than GNU APL.)
  --display=DISPLAY        X display to use


In use, aplwrap simply provides a textual interface to GNU APL.  The
only things that aren't obvious are that pressing "Enter" on any non-empty
line sends the contents of that line to apl--you don't have to copy-n-paste
to re-execute a line--and that under the "Help" button is another button
that brings up a keymap image.

Contact me if I've screwed anything up or if there's a feature you want added.

Have fun,
